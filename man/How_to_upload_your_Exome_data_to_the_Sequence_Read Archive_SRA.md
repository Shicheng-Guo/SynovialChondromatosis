STEP 1. Creat BioProject

Go to the [BioProject Submission portal](https://submit.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/subs/bioproject/)

Click on New submission

Step 1 Submitter: There shouldn't be any problem, just ask yourself who you are.
Step 2 Project Type: My Project data type is "Transcriptome or Gene expression" and my Sample scope is "Multiisolate" because I am comparing multiple individuals within the same species.
Step 3 Target: The only required slot is organism name.
Step 4 General Info: You will be asked to select a publication date. It could be immediate or as far as 4 years later or upon publication. Then you will have to put as project title and description.
Step 5 BioSample: Here's the fun part! If you are like me, the first time user, you will have to click on register at BioSample first then come back to this page later.
